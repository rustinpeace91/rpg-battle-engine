  "description": "Right now this game is simply a turn based combat engine. The user is randomly supplied a weapon and a random number of hitpoints, and can fight multiple enemies who are also randomly generated. The player has health points, a defensive rating (based on armor) and does a certain amount of damage based on the weapon they are carrying. The game engine is heavily based on the D20 System. My main inspiration for this game was the [Pathfinder Rulebook:](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/01/PFRPG_SRD.pdf)",
